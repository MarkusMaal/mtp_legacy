Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.59,0:00:40.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,These videos are not public anymore, because they either contain false information and/or I'm not satisfied with them.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.27,0:00:43.32,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And I didn't want them to be public anymore.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.65,0:00:47.69,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,In case you want to see these videos anyway, for some reason
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.92,0:00:54.79,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Then you'll find these from the Markus Maal channel's playlist "Prügikast" ("Trash")

Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.99,0:02:11.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,This is also where I should mention that the content on this new channel is exclusively in English. But if you don't understand English, there are also Estonian subtitles available.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.89,0:02:20.94,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,The next topic is related to a Markus Computer Entertainment video, which I postponed.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.22,0:02:23.00,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I.e., the Momonga Linux video (I said "Momonga OS", but meant to say "Momonga Linux" obviously)
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.87,0:02:32.90,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I postponed it in order to first publish a video about Windows 10 Ameliorated Edition.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.40,0:02:45.27,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,This is also an interesting video, because I am experimenting with multiple camera angles for the very first time.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.89,0:02:54.75,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,It seems that people are enjoying the Markus Computer Entertainment videos, so I will continue to make them.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.07,0:03:07.67,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,More specifically, about the fact that all videos on that channel now have English subtitles available.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.89,0:03:14.22,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,Of course, with the exception of live streams, which don't have subtitles.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.42,0:03:22.79,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,Keeping in mind, of course, that live streams on average are about 4 hours, or even longer.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.80,0:03:27.40,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,The next sad thing about Markus' stuff channel is
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.50,0:03:35.35,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,...is that I am no longer going to upload any new videos to that channel.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.47,0:03:38.52,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Or make any new live streams.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.02,0:03:49.65,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,All of the videos that I've uploaded TO THAT CHANNEL so far, will still be accessible, but don't expect any new videos from that channel.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.99,0:04:23.27,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Then I'm planning to bring these videos back.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.62,0:04:34.52,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Now, a question for the viewers - should I continue the series and name the episodes accordingly...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.90,0:04:44.47,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Or should I rename the series to "Tegelane mängib" ("mmaal (markustegelane) plays" for the English translation) and start numbering the episodes from the beginning?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.84,0:04:57.09,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I have considered the second option, mainly because the first episode of "Markus Maal plays" has been lost with time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.42,0:05:00.84,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Due to copyright issues.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.45,0:05:14.92,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,If anyone watching does, then let me know, but personally, I don't have this video stored anywhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.94,0:05:16.04,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Which is sad
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.42,0:05:32.89,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Here's a list of three games I'm going to play for the first four episodes. One of them is a secret, because I'm unsure if I'm going to play that game (which is why I haven't listed it here).

Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.47,0:05:50.85,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, in case you are unaware, on May 5th, I uploaded 5 separate videos, on a single day.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.05,0:05:53.27,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,You may be wondering: wait ho...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.44,0:05:56.85,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,why did I do that? and what's the point of those videos?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.14,0:06:04.15,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,You may notice that these videos are really short. None of them are over 2 minutes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.60,0:06:08.32,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, these are actually "Computer tips" videos.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.72,0:06:29.49,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I wanted to make new videos for the "Computer tips" playlist and display them on my channel page, so that only the new videos for that playlist would be visible.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.67,0:06:32.35,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I also thought these videos would be very useful.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.70,0:06:39.22,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,The only video I'm not really satisfied about, simply because of the view count is...

Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.62,0:07:00.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I also uploaded an updated version of the "How to see graphics card information" video.
