Hello people! Today I am showcasing a new version of Windows that you have never seen before!

3
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:09,000
I got exclusive access to the beta version for the beta version of Windows 13!

4
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:12,257
And we're on the desktop!

5
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:15,443
On a brand new desktop!

6
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:19,105
With a brand new background image!

7
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:32,967
As you can see, the new wallpaper has a very minimalistic design.

8
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:35,847
And also a new taskbar

9
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:40,616
New, as you can see. There's still access to the start menu

10
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:52,000
Settings icon, application store

11
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,635
File manager

12
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,176
VLC

13
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:03,567
Terminal, Pinta...

14
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:09,554
I mean Paint, that's absolutely just paint and not some other program!

15
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:13,900
notepad, and everything else

16
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:20,434
And a brand new Microsoft's office suite!

17
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:25,746
Such as Michaelsoft Letter, Michaelsoft Isuc, and Michaelsoft Weakpoint!

18
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:30,367
I can't believe it! It's a brand new and very unique version of Windows!

19
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:37,834
Something completely brand new, something nobody has seen before!

20
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,834
Lets start with the file manager!

21
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:49,034
As you can see, there are still rounded corners.

22
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:58,073
But as a brand new feature, there's now an option to split the current folder you're on!

23
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:03,348
You may be wondering, why is that useful? Let me show you!

24
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:08,672
First of all, here's one folder...

25
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:13,781
Let me insert a storage medium that actually contains some files.

26
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:25,318
And every time you insert a new USB device, Windows asks whether or not you want to connect it! Unbelieveably awesome!

27
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:35,300
So, if you have a faulty drive, it doesn't get too much stress reading data unless you say to insert it.

28
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:39,000
You can probably also run your .EXE file....

29
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,261
Dialog box: What would you like to do with this file?

30
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:49,461
We can go to a folder, such as music...

31
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,448
and then we CANN

32
00:03:55,043 --> 00:04:05,034
And as you can see, we support... Windows supports multiple tabs in the file manager, which means...

33
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:15,457
that browsing your files is... You don't have to open 10 windows and search for which one you want to use.

34
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:22,910
So, that was My Computer. One more thing... If we change the path here...

35
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:29,827
Then you can see that Windows now uses a brand new file path system!

36
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:36,100
There is no C:\ drive anymore! Everything starts from /!

37
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:43,000
For example, our user folder is /home/markus

38
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:54,393
So, this is our C:\ folder, a.k.a. the / folder

39
00:04:58,704 --> 00:05:00,704
In case you think I'm joking. (shows that path is indeed "/")

40
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:07,208
You may be asking, where's my D: drive, where's my E: drive, where's my F: drive... well

41
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:12,903
The answer is that they are now located at...

42
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,871
I'm pretty sure it was the /media folder...

43
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:22,500
Yup, here's my thumbdrive. We can explore it.

44
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:33,167
This is a brand new photos app.

45
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:42,200
It starts up really fast and there is no other unneeded carp!

46
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:52,668
This is Michaelsoft Letter! Microsoft decided to rename the programs on their office suite.

47
00:05:55,216 --> 00:06:01,559
It's really similar in terms of feature set to Microsoft Word (as it should be)

48
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:06,443
Not much has changed, other than the design and layout of things.

49
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,729
This is Michaelsoft Isuc

50
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:14,500
And this is Michaelsoft Weakpoint!

51
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:23,112
Which you can use to make amazing presentations, where your weak points never get heard!

52
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,362
Maybe you saw another new thing.

53
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,001
If we open updates

54
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:42,091
Everyone knows that Windows updates are really annoying! They tend to install themselves automatically without your permission...

55
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,440
But not anymore! Because Windows 13 eliminates this problem completely!

56
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:52,671
Wait, is it going to install Windows 14 here?

57
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,792
Yeah, absolutely...

58
00:06:56,131 --> 00:07:00,677
It's probably Windows 13.1 or something, but I don't care right now!

59
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:07,134
And as you saw, it was really easy to postpone updates, no need to install them right away when you don't want to!

60
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:16,867
The settings app has also been updated, so...

61
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:24,387
It looks a bit like Windows 11 settings app, but it isn't that...

62
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,680
What is a KDE neon?

63
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,681
This is the new paint app!

64
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,434
As you can see, it's still possible to dra...

65
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:39,135
You can still draw!

66
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:45,767
But in addition to drawing stuff... [that sound]

67
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,542
There's layers, so that we can add new layers!

68
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:54,195
That is one of the things people have always asked Microsoft to do, but they've never actually done it!

69
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:58,834
There's layers in Paint now! That's unbelievable!

70
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:02,461
Like in every other fuggin picture editing program...

71
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:09,203
Next up... I accidentally opened VLC media player! YAY!

72
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:17,534
Let me tell you, this isn't Lunix, okay... some smart people may point out this is just Lunix, but it isn't!

73
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,001
this is 100% Windows 13

74
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:23,734
Next up we open the command line, which looks totally awesome!

75
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,895
This totally isn't just Lunix...

76
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:31,752
I can confirm this to you...

77
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,993
This isn't Lunix, it's Linux...

78
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,431
Happy April 1st!
