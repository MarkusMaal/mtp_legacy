Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.00,0:01:03.87,Default,,0,0,0,,The new name reflects the lightweight content this channel produces.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.05,0:01:13.24,Default,,0,0,0,,The reason for this change was that the old name was confusing for viewers.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.49,0:01:16.37,Default,,0,0,0,,For example, the x in the old name was not related to number 10.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.80,0:01:52.29,Default,,0,0,0,,In case you don't, it was a chat-client, which was 100% made in the batch scripting language.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.35,0:02:08.72,Default,,0,0,0,,However, this batch file had a big limitation - it didn't work on the internet.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.07,0:02:14.17,Default,,0,0,0,,This meant that every chatroom was limited to a single computer.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.69,0:02:24.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, it was possible to share the chatroom folder in a local area network and mount it on another computer as a network drive, but I didn't show you how to do it exactly.
