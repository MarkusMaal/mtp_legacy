Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.34,0:00:22.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Why would I do this?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.12,0:00:26.92,Default,,0,0,0,,One reason is, because I want to know what happens.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.54,0:00:54.94,Default,,0,0,0,,As you can see, this processor isn't that good.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.94,0:01:01.40,Default,,0,0,0,,The biggest problem with this laptop is that it has
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.40,0:01:10.54,Default,,0,0,0,,In other words, this laptop basically screams when you even open 49 tabs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.54,0:01:15.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Now imagine, if I opened 1000 tabs on this laptop.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.04,0:01:18.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, this thing would explode.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.57,0:01:26.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Second problem, if we look at the CPU, it only has 2 cores.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.70,0:01:30.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Once again, a pretty slow processor.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.82,0:01:35.69,Default,,0,0,0,,For this experiment, we are going to turn off this laptop.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.24,0:02:06.69,Default,,0,0,0,,The answer is simple.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.47,0:02:10.25,Default,,0,0,0,,We are going to use AutoHotkey scripts.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.62,0:02:12.92,Default,,0,0,0,,This is where the AutoHotkey folder is
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.95,0:02:17.44,Default,,0,0,0,,And here is...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.44,0:02:20.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, we accidentally opened the script.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.05,0:02:23.39,Default,,0,0,0,,But I wasn't an idiot.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.39,0:02:29.30,Default,,0,0,0,,We first need to press Alt+1

Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.92,0:02:37.85,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what does this script do? It opens 1000 web pages.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.14,0:02:52.07,Default,,0,0,0,,So, do this 5 times times times times times.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.07,0:02:56.02,Default,,0,0,0,,If we count the lines...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.02,0:03:01.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Then it's 200 lines, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.57,0:03:03.79,Default,,0,0,0,,We are basically going to open
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.50,0:03:09.24,Default,,0,0,0,,5x200 tabs, i.e. 1000 tabs.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.24,0:03:12.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Because 5 times 200 equals 1000.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.32,0:03:19.34,Default,,0,0,0,,So, with just a single key combination, we can open 1000 tabs.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.34,0:03:22.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And our AutoHotkey script is active.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.47,0:03:28.22,Default,,0,0,0,,The second thing I prepared
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.40,0:03:37.40,Default,,0,0,0,,was a small Chrome extension, that shows the tab count.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.39,0:03:41.70,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to open OBS and see what happens.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.40,0:03:48.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Let's open OBS, start screen capturing, and open 1000 Chrome tabs - what could possibly go wrong?

Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.72,0:04:16.59,Default,,0,0,0,,and if we open more tabs, the number increases.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.70,0:04:21.57,Default,,0,0,0,,And if we open CPU-Z on this computer.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.57,0:04:27.10,Default,,0,0,0,,For some reason, I didn't think about opening this.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.99,0:04:33.82,Default,,0,0,0,,But as you can see, we have a Ryzen processor.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.82,0:04:39.19,Default,,0,0,0,,It's considerably more powerful than the one we had on the other laptop.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.19,0:04:43.90,Default,,0,0,0,,And it has 16 threads.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.50,0:04:47.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Hopefully it can manage.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.67,0:04:51.34,Default,,0,0,0,,And we have 16GB of random access memory.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.29,0:04:55.49,Default,,0,0,0,,And we have a NVMe Intel SSD.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.52,0:05:09.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And let's keep track of numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.72,0:05:13.07,Default,,0,0,0,,I haven't tested this script before, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.07,0:05:16.00,Default,,0,0,0,,...it's possible it's not going to even work on the first attempt.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.97,0:05:21.45,Default,,0,0,0,,But let's see what happens.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.45,0:05:23.15,Default,,0,0,0,,{\an8}ALT+1
