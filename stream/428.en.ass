Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.30,0:00:34.66,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,In many of these Markus computer entertainment videos, I've shown a phone that boots several different operating systems,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.86,0:00:38.14,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,which includes Ubuntu Touch, Sailfish, Android versions, or whatever.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.86,0:00:41.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Now, the question is: how?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.18,0:00:45.74,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,In some videos, I've been able to boot multiple operating systems within a single smart phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.34,0:00:53.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And in this video, I am going to show you the tool that lets you do that, which allows you to multiboot operating systems.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.82,0:00:57.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,This is Multirom by Tassadar
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.54,0:01:01.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,We'll restart the device, and I'll adjust the brightness first...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.58,0:01:10.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,As you can see, Multirom, which allows us to boot multiple operating systems, lets us choose what to boot from a list.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.86,0:01:16.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,In Multirom, there's a primary ROM and secondary ROMs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.82,0:01:22.38,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,If you're tech savvy, you might say that these are not ROMs, these are operating systems and
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.70,0:01:34.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,that's a good point, but what you need to keep in mind is that the community has always referred to these custom firmware modifications as ROMs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.18,0:01:37.66,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Everyone's calling them ROMs.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.98,0:01:39.98,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, {\b1\i1}deal with it{\b0\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.06,0:01:45.90,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,There are three tabs. INTERNAL lets you boot OSs from internal storage.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.78,0:01:53.66,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,EXTERNAL is interesting... If you have a USB device and you want to boot OSs from it, then it's possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.98,0:02:00.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,{\an8}And as it says here, once you insert the USB it's mounted and bootable OSs are detected automatically.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.82,0:02:10.70,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,First option: {\i1}COPY LOG TO /SDCARD{\i0}, allows you to copy a log.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.30,0:02:29.06,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Next options: reboot, allow you to reboot your device in several different ways and {\i1}SHUTDOWN{\i0} shuts down the device.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.18,0:02:46.62,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,and another interesting feature here is...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.42,0:02:57.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And yes, it's pretty hard, but yes, that's an easter egg.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.18,0:03:00.70,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I won. How is that possible?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.70,0:03:03.62,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And you can press the power button to return to the main menu.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.63,0:03:07.86,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I'll just boot the primary operating system as a demonstration.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:08.30,0:03:11.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Which in this phone is CyanogenMod 12

Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.26,0:03:16.86,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Then it'll boot up.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.86,0:03:21.58,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And our device will boot into the operating system.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.90,0:03:28.30,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And yes, I'll be back in a moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.54,0:03:31.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,As you can see, we've booted into an operating system.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.70,0:03:37.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And this is the OS, where we have an app called "MultiROM manager" installed.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.38,0:03:41.90,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Which allows you to manage these operating systems.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.42,0:03:43.90,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, if we start it up here...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.62,0:03:50.46,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,...then you see that {\i1}This device is not officially supported{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.78,0:03:57.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I really wanted to use an officially supported device, but I was unable to do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.50,0:04:00.46,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Because that device still has battery problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.02,0:04:03.94,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,But what we can do is check out what is available to us.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.22,0:04:10.70,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,MultiROM has three components:\N1. MultiROM itself, which shows us the menu, which allows us to choose an OS and stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.82,0:04:13.74,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,2. Recovery, which we'll talk about later in this video.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:13.98,0:04:22.86,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,3. Kernel, which has the {\i1\c&H11FF00&}kexec hardboot patch{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.58,0:04:25.86,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,And if we look at the {\i1}Manage ROMs{\i0} menu...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.18,0:04:29.22,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Then we'll see all of our ROMs. We can rename them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.26,0:04:32.38,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And we can also change the icons.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.06,0:04:35.02,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,These are the built-in icons.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.22,0:04:39.66,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,For KitKat we can use... maybe this one...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.10,0:04:42.74,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,We can change the icon and if we reboot, it'll be applied.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.98,0:04:44.78,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And while this is the OmniROM icon, nobody really cares.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.10,0:04:46.38,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I just wanted to demonstrate a point.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.39,0:04:50.94,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Next. We can also reboot and we have options.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.62,0:04:57.58,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,If this were an officially supported device, we could also install Ubuntu Touch from here, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.42,0:05:00.30,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Yeah, this device is unsupported, we can't do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.54,0:05:06.70,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,We also have an autoboot function. If we press {\i1}CANCEL{\i0}, it goes away.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.06,0:05:09.50,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And as you can see, our icon has been applied successfully.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.02,0:05:14.22,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I'll now just boot {\i1}Firefox OS{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.70,0:05:15.30,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Because why not.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.94,0:05:19.90,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Then you'll notice something interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:20.14,0:05:21.22,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,The device reboots.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.70,0:05:27.54,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,If you noticed what happened with the primary ROM, it just booted into the OS without rebooting the device.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.94,0:05:33.78,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Maybe you'll notice something funny in Firefox OS...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.46,0:05:42.06,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,We have this interesting thing going across the screen, but if we lock and unlock the device, it's gone.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.07,0:05:44.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I don't know why this trick works, but it does anyway.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.82,0:05:51.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Firefox, a few years ago, closed the Marketplace, which means that it doesn't work anymore.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.46,0:05:56.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,But if we open the browser, it actually does work.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.74,0:05:59.90,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I have tried a few test sites already. And it does indeed work.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.82,0:06:03.78,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,{\an9\pos(1868,168)}check the card!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.18,0:06:04.58,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I made a whole video about Firefox OS, where I demonstrated the Marketplace back when it did work.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.94,0:06:06.62,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, you should watch that video.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.86,0:06:08.50,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,If we now reboot the device.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.06,0:06:12.82,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Then our OS will shut down and we'll be brought back to the MultiROM menu.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.10,0:06:18.82,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,One thing I forgot... Okay I'll first show what happens when we tap {\i1}REBOOT TO BOOTLOADER{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.90,0:06:23.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Yeah, we get this menu.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.66,0:06:30.46,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,It's a mode where you can flash recoveries, operating systems, and other stuff, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.26,0:06:36.54,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,Speaking of recovery, there's one thing I haven't shown you yet. {\i1}REBOOT TO RECOVERY{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.78,0:06:42.38,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,MultiROM uses its very own recovery environment, where you can flash ROMs.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.42,0:06:47.70,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, it's a customized version of TeamWin Recovery Project (TWRP)
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.06,0:06:57.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Which works like the normal version of TWRP, but... if you tap here then BOOM, {\i1}MultiROM{\i0} - {\i1}Main Menu{\i0}

Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.82,0:10:36.86,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Next, we can choose what source we should use for the OS.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.22,0:10:43.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,We can choose between {\i1}Zip file{\i0}, which is what we showed earlier.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:43.82,0:10:49.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Backup{\i0}, which is interesting, because you can restore a TWRP backup and use it as a secondary OS.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.98,0:10:54.62,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And sideloading through ADB, if you want to install something directly from your computer.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.86,0:10:56.82,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, we'll choose {\i1}Zip file{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.30,0:11:00.98,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And we'll choose downloads...

Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.86,0:11:11.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I haven't tried to install it before this video, lets see what happens with this ZIP file.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.74,0:11:23.58,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,We'll select {\i1}Reboot system{\i0} and try to boot this OS.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.90,0:11:26.34,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,As you can see, we'll appear into this menu just like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.66,0:11:35.22,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,As you can see, it's using a very ugly name, as well as a general icon. I'll show you how to change it later.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:35.54,0:11:39.86,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,But just to test if it works... lets see if it boots.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.62,0:11:45.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Okay, the device is rebooting...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.86,0:11:49.94,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And lets see if it kernel panics or boots into the system.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.58,0:11:55.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Okay...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:56.78,0:12:01.46,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Oh, the screen turned off, the device rebooted....
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.38,0:12:10.14,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I have a feeling this isn't going to work, which is unfortunate, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.42,0:12:17.50,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Yes, so as you can see, the compatibility isn't perfect.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:19.54,0:12:29.98,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,In order to show you how this works, we'll show you a folder called {\i1}multirom{\i0} in the internal memory.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.94,0:12:35.70,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And if you select a folder called {\i1}roms{\i0}, then here are all of these systems.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.94,0:13:00.54,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, the first thing that happens when you boot a ROM is that boot.img gets flashed, which has been injected with MultiROM.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.62,0:13:05.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And then your device is rebooted.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:05.66,0:13:10.06,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,In order to use the new kernel, that's why the device reboots.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:10.38,0:13:17.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,But you may be asking: why does it go back to MultiROM once the device is rebooted, even after we flashed a new kernel?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:17.90,0:13:23.94,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,The reason is simple: because it flashes back to kernel, because it's been flashed and it can do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:25.42,0:13:33.62,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,If we didn't patch it, we would just keep booting back into the MultiROM menu again and again and again....
Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.94,0:13:35.50,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Which isn't obviously what we want to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:43.86,0:13:48.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,One interesting feature I didn't show was {\i1}Swap ROMs{\i0}...
Dialogue: 0,0:13:49.34,0:13:59.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Here we can swap the primary ROM with a secondary ROM. And here we have everything we can swap with it.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.94,0:14:04.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I don't know if I would ever do this, probably not.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.86,0:14:08.22,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:09.10,0:14:15.14,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,{\i1}Duplicate secondary ROM{\i0}, that's probably the safest thing we can do.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:16.78,0:14:20.10,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Altough, I really don't want to do anything right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.38,0:14:24.94,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,But the idea is that you can either Swap your primary ROM with one of the secondary ones...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:25.58,0:14:27.46,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Copy primary ROM to one of the secondaries
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.74,0:14:31.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Or copy secondary ROM to another secondary ROM.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:31.70,0:14:33.78,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Basically, you can copy, paste, move, whatever.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.34,0:14:36.34,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And you can choose a name.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.58,0:14:48.74,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I also want to show you another thing that can happen when your OS doesn't want to boot.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:50.50,0:14:52.50,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, if I choose {\i1}Android Kitkat{\i0} here...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.42,0:14:56.46,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Which I hoped would work...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:56.78,0:15:04.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Then the device does reboot, you maybe hopeful that it's going to work, but boom.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.38,0:15:08.66,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,kernel panic YAY
Dialogue: 0,0:15:09.38,0:15:14.66,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I want to show you one more operating system that is also based on Android, but that does actually start up.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.78,0:15:17.34,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,That would be MIUI 8.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.54,0:15:36.58,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I was planning to make a Markus computer entertainment video about MIUI 8, but I never did for some reason. I don't know why, but I didn't.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:41.22,0:15:43.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,WOW, it's working so well in this phone.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:52.62,0:15:56.78,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,As you can see, a completely different system.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:07.78,0:16:09.02,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Okay, this is interesting.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:17.38,0:16:19.42,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And it's based on Android Marshmallow.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:22.66,0:16:24.94,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I don't know why it's so slow right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:26.22,0:16:27.82,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,It was so much faster before.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:46.86,0:16:56.34,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Another interesting thing - there's a built-in Play Store app. I didn't install it, it was just included with the OS.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:57.22,0:17:00.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,You can also download themes and stuff like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:01.02,0:17:05.26,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,But I've noticed it requires a Xiaomi account, like wha? why?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.30,0:17:06.22,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Like why?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:06.86,0:17:09.70,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Why? Why do I need an account to install themes?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:10.90,0:17:12.38,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Like, what the hell?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:13.22,0:17:16.06,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,We can also boot into recovery and fastboot really quickly.

Dialogue: 0,0:17:28.26,0:17:34.82,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,So, this was MultiROM. So yeah, this was a kind of behind the scenes overview.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:35.30,0:17:37.58,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Like what's happening behin... behin.. behind.. the scenes like?

Dialogue: 0,0:17:45.94,0:17:51.54,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Yup, remember how we had a ROM with a very ugly name and icon?
Dialogue: 0,0:17:52.26,0:17:55.54,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Now, an interesting way to fix it...
Dialogue: 0,0:17:57.02,0:18:00.98,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,You can rename it.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:01.98,0:18:03.62,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,As you can see, I renamed it.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:04.06,0:18:06.06,Tegelane3,,0,0,0,,We can also change the icon.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:07.14,0:18:11.50,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And... boom, we have the Paranoid Android icon.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.74,0:18:15.22,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And the very last thing I want to show you is how to delete ROMs.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:16.10,0:18:22.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,If we try to delete it, it notifies us and says "{\i1}hey, you sure you know what you're doing{\i0}?".

Dialogue: 0,0:18:27.14,0:18:29.34,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Pretty quickly and efficiently.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:30.62,0:18:34.78,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And yes, MultiROM Manager requires root access.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:35.94,0:18:41.18,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,I didn't use MultiROM in my Sailfish OS video, for example.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:42.18,0:18:44.22,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Just because I couldn't get it to work.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:44.90,0:18:50.58,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,And I also didn't use it in my Android Oreo overview, for the same reason.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:50.82,0:18:59.74,Tegelane2,,0,0,0,,Because the latest OS MultiROM officially supports is Android 6.0 Marshmallow.
