Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.30,0:00:29.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, so the first step is of course to download Linux Mint.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.00,0:00:32.99,Default,,0,0,0,,So, go to the home page of Linux Mint.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.69,0:00:54.85,Default,,0,0,0,,And let's choose a mirror that's closer to us.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.14,0:01:04.09,Default,,0,0,0,,While our operating system is downloading...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.69,0:01:13.34,Default,,0,0,0,,It's a good idea to talk about a software program we're going to use to make a bootable USB.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.39,0:01:18.55,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to download the Rufus program.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.72,0:01:47.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And give the program administrative privileges.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.97,0:01:50.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Then we can see our flash drive.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.77,0:02:22.15,Default,,0,0,0,,For this, we're going to...

Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.92,0:03:38.87,Default,,0,0,0,,So, now you'll have the option to either write the image in ISO or DD mode.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.52,0:03:44.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Basically, choose ISO mode and if that doesn't work, choose DD mode.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.74,0:05:22.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Now we can safely eject the flash drive.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:24.89,0:05:32.37,Default,,0,0,0,,And insert it into a computer, we wish to boot the OS from.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.22,0:05:38.75,Default,,0,0,0,,So, this is the laptop, we plan on installing Linux Mint to.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.15,0:06:03.44,Default,,0,0,0,,We hear a ding.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.47,0:06:06.85,Default,,0,0,0,,And if we open my computer...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.92,0:06:13.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Then we see autoplay
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.80,0:06:19.60,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is our USB, where we have

Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.10,0:06:34.37,Default,,0,0,0,,...access your computer's SETUP program, because
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.37,0:06:40.54,Default,,0,0,0,,which we can use to make it so that the computer doesn't boot from the internal drive, but instead from the flash drive.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.15,0:06:44.55,Default,,0,0,0,,For that we need to enter SETUP program.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.84,0:06:47.44,Default,,0,0,0,,There are 2 ways to do it. The first method...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.15,0:06:49.69,Default,,0,0,0,,If we hold...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.85,0:06:56.47,Default,,0,0,0,,We open power options in the start menu and see the option for Restart.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.19,0:07:08.32,Default,,0,0,0,,We see a text that says "Please wait"

Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.70,0:07:34.17,Default,,0,0,0,,And if we click "Restart"
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.67,0:07:41.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Then our laptop goes to this "Startup Menu"
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.87,0:07:46.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And from here we can choose "BIOS Setup"
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.45,0:07:51.94,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is the SETUP program.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.50,0:08:57.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So, let's use the Escape key method.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.79,0:09:00.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Let me turn it on.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.32,0:09:02.30,Default,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to repeatedly tap the Escape key.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.60,0:09:09.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Then we get to the same menu.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.39,0:09:12.99,Default,,0,0,0,,And here we can press F10.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.07,0:09:16.99,Default,,0,0,0,,To go to the boot options (I mean to say BIOS setup, sorry)
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.09,0:09:23.52,Default,,0,0,0,,The first thing we want to find...

Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.10,0:09:50.97,Default,,0,0,0,,So, that's the thing here.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.87,0:09:55.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Your computer might have a different setting for this.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.37,0:09:56.59,Default,,0,0,0,,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.47,0:10:01.29,Default,,0,0,0,,then... since this isn't a legacy operating system...

Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.95,0:10:09.74,Default,,0,0,0,,We just want to clear secure boot keys.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.39,0:10:15.25,Default,,0,0,0,,I already did that, which is why it's showing the message.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.80,0:10:21.05,Default,,0,0,0,,And here we have boot order.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.47,0:10:26.94,Default,,0,0,0,,As you can see we have USB Diskette/Hard Disk set as first.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.50,0:10:33.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Here, it tells us that F5 and F6 keys move the options around, so if we do that...

Dialogue: 0,0:10:37.25,0:10:40.15,Default,,0,0,0,,So, OS boot Manager is our internal storage

Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.15,0:10:54.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Like that. But that increases boot time, if we put unneeded stuff first in the boot order.

Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.75,0:11:20.37,Default,,0,0,0,,And then your computer should automatically boot into the flash drive.
