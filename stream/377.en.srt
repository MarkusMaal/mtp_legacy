00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,110
Hello, people! 

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,170
I want to check if I'm recording...

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Yup, I'm recording right now and push-to-talk is working

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,380
Everything is correct

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:55,100
For those who don't know... I have a Minecraft blog and in this amazing world called "hey, survive"

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,520
I have beaten that dragon

7
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,310
Now... I want to beat this dragon again.

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,100
Lets see what happens

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:20,400
And I have a strong wind around here, hope that doesn't affect the recording. Lets start with the video.

10
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:25,540
So first, lets prepare for everything

11
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,100
Then we'll go to the nether and...

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,440
...go into the end portal and respawn the dragon

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,500
To collect a few bottles of dragon's breath... and to get some XP

14
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,590
Because I really, really need XP

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
But lets start

16
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,420
And we have a lot of rockets to fly with an elytra

17
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,900
and to destroy those... amazing... end crystals

18
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,510
which in fact, we collected, some time ago, when we were in the nether

19
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,260
we have 4 amazing end crystals

20
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,340
wow

21
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,540
We'll obviously be taking some end crystals with us, in order to respawn the end dragon

22
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,200
we'll also be taking a water bucket to avoid problems... with the ender men

23
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,450
or rather to solve problems with ender men

24
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,400
to AVOID problems...

25
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,550
we have this wonderful thing called "carved pumpkin"

26
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,360
wow

27
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,260
I'm looking really good right now, people

28
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,460
we are wearing a wonderful pumpkin, we are wearing a sword

29
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,280
we have a cool chip, which i haven't shown you, but we do have a chip... i mean shield

30
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,430
and we are wearing a wonderful pumpkin

31
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,380
of course we'll need our blast resistance... obviously

32
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:28,400
hmmm... what else could we take with us? bow? bow will stay here...

33
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:43,580
or actually we'll take the bow with us.. we don't need rotten flesh... we'll take chorus fruit, just in case... we'll take one ender pearl also

34
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,260
we'll take empty bottles with us, to collect dragon's breath

35
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:12,590
we really take it with us... I'll also be looking at other potions I could bring to the end...

36
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
where did it go?

37
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,200
nice

38
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,100
a little lesson here: use your dshield [woosh]

39
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
actually use your shield, if you can

40
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
*sigh*

41
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
*explosion*

42
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,130
don't ask how the chicken go into the nether

43
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,230
oh hello... speed II...

44
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,530
suddenly in a random chest i don't know about

45
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:51,280
the only way i can retrieve this potion again is using the road in the nether

46
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,110
now comes the hard decision time: what will I take and what will I leave here?

47
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:50,290
i would like to build a little shelther in the end... in case things turn for the worst, so i may want to take a few blocks

48
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,350
oh, and we have empty glass bottles here..

49
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
people, we're officially in the end

50
00:18:50,100 --> 00:19:00,100
endermen: *sup* *hey* *lokfoteaay*

51
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:13,420
as you can see, there are a lot of these... ender men... and I can't look at them, unless I'm wwaring a pumpkin on my head

52
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:21,590
but if i'm wearing a pumpkin, i either have to use the third person perpective or see poke through the holes on the pumpkin

53
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,400
everybody is looking at me, being like: "what are you doing herer?" :D

54
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,490
my display was on minimum brightness owow

55
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,250
these ender men are agrovated by the dragon

56
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
you're winner

57
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,200
people, we beat the dragon... roughly, but we did

58
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:52,590
and that's that... we got 17 levels... and a lot of dragon's breath

59
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,480
I'll unequip this silly pumpkin to see something

60
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,500
ok, so that is where the second end gateway is.

61
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and now we have about... 127 dragon's breath, which we can use to make different kinds of potions

62
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:10,220
yeah, we beat the dragon second time and that's that

63
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:46,510
wth why are there so many mobs? like, why did so many zombies just spawn? jc

64
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,270
*inhales* Lets see...

65
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:03,420
wow, why were there so many zombies all of a sudden? no idea. wth

66
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,520
they're fine

67
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:08,520
that probably explains why so many zombies spawned, they all wanted to destroy the villagers

68
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:14,370
but thanks to iron golems, villagers were saved

69
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:14,470
and we have 4 ender eyes right now (?)

70
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:39,180
And that was it for the video. Thank you for watching! Have a nice day! Hope I didn't forget to start recording, that would have been a good joke...

71
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,420
but I'll stop recording NOW
