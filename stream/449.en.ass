Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:10.95,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Okay hello, so this is the second devupdate for the Blue Screen Simulator Plus 2.1 project!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.94,0:00:15.00,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So lets have some fun, shall we?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.79,0:00:22.60,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Okay, lets start with the new updates of this blue screen simulator plus 2.1 update
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.40,0:00:27.10,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,second devUpdate, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.59,0:00:34.27,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So, this is the second devUpdate. This build of Blue Screen simulator plus...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.75,0:00:41.57,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,...has several improvements and enhancements over the previous previous build showcased in the previous devUpdate video
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.40,0:00:51.04,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,The first update is that in the NT error message field, you can now specify a custom error!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.80,0:00:55.30,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So, if I set this message to "CHICKEN"
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.62,0:00:57.79,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,just a random example
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.62,0:01:02.27,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,We click "Simulate", and you can see it says "CHICKEN" in the stop code
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.30,0:01:07.44,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Next change you may have noticed, if you were paying close attention...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.55,0:01:19.37,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Is that by default now, the progress indicator, now doesn't just increment by one, it actually looks much more realistic
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.39,0:01:24.40,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So it increments by a random number
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.65,0:01:32.00,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And just like that, the error screen closes.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.64,0:01:36.97,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,But I didn't stop there, I created a whole progress tuning utility.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.32,0:01:45.55,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,What this allows you to do is set how much the progress indicator gets incremented by during each time interval
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.45,0:01:49.55,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,(squeak, squeak)
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.25,0:01:56.09,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,In theory, this should only go up to 90% and also increment by 17% at one point.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.87,0:01:58.54,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So lets see, if that's the case.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.60,0:02:05.47,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And right there, it incremented by 17%.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.62,0:02:11.75,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And it stops at 90%
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.82,0:02:17.55,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So we set the total time to 5 time units...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:19.02,0:02:27.79,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Lets actually set it to 2 time units, so that we can see that it's not exactly 2 seconds.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.62,0:02:42.64,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So lets showcase what this looks like.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.89,0:02:46.70,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And that wasn't 2 seconds, was it?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.99,0:02:49.92,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And yeah, without auto-restart, it just stays there.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.69,0:02:54.85,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Next up, there are updates if you go to the settings!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:55.45,0:02:57.92,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,In the simulator settings, there's a bunch of new stuff here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.82,0:03:01.45,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So, first of all...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.54,0:03:06.55,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,...there's an option to add randomness to progress counters in legacy configurations.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.05,0:03:08.89,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So, what I mean by that...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.74,0:03:11.40,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,is that...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.12,0:03:16.05,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,If you open a legacy configuration, like this one...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.55,0:03:26.09,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,By default, it's doing the linear increment by one, that it was doing before. And that's okay.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.17,0:03:27.92,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,But...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.47,0:03:33.10,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,What this option allows you to do, is add randomness to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.10,0:03:35.72,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,You can see, how it's more realistic.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.25,0:03:41.32,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,But lets say you want to go back to the defaults.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.85,0:03:43.34,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,How would you do that?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.55,0:03:50.02,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Of course, as the developer, I have access to these buttons, which are not available in the final version.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.39,0:03:57.19,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,It's not accessible, unless you enable "Developer mode" (it's a secret mode)
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.39,0:04:01.35,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Now you have access to some of these options.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.65,0:04:06.34,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,In {\i1}Developer mode{\i0}, {\i1}New all{\i0} basically restores the defaults.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.65,0:04:09.39,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And {\u1\i1}Nuke all{\u0\i0} just removes all of the configs.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.95,0:04:16.62,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,But you are actually able to do this, if you check {\i1}Select all configurations{\i0} here
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.69,0:04:19.80,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And you can remove configurations.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.84,0:04:21.77,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Which shows a {\c&H00FFFF&\3c&H009CFF&}warning{\c&H000000&\3c&HFFFF00&}.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.00,0:04:28.52,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And then we can reset everything.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.47,0:04:31.77,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,We also have the {\i1}Reset hacks{\i0} option.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.32,0:04:38.74,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Which resets everything under the {\i1}Additional options{\i0} menu, yes
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.35,0:04:48.10,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,But if we go here, all the configs have been reset and we actually have a different sort of progress incrementation.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.10,0:04:48.94,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,{\an5\3c&HE900FF&\fs72}SOAP
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.39,0:04:57.57,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,There's actually now a way... to export into different configuration file formats.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.80,0:05:03.09,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Previously, in version 2.0, you only had this.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.09,0:05:04.94,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Now you also have this one.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.57,0:05:09.40,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,But the previous version also didn't have this option here.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.95,0:05:14.67,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And we can save as that format.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.79,0:05:21.19,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And when we do that, it's going to ask what are we going to use as the Windows 10 screen...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.79,0:05:32.40,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,In the older version, you didn't have a way to create multiple blue screens of the same operating system.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.65,0:05:35.12,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,This is why it's asking you that.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.15,0:05:38.44,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,It auto-detects, which ones are suitable, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.39,0:05:43.99,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,With the default configuration, all we have to do is just smash yes and yes and yes...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:44.75,0:05:48.24,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So, this right here, is version 1.0.1.2
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.00,0:05:55.67,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,I think this was the version that fixed the text, that said wrong things.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.54,0:06:00.70,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,But if you go to the {\i1}Hacks{\i0} menu and actually load this file.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.74,0:06:02.00,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,And it loads.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.67,0:06:07.22,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,If we go to Windows Vista/7, we can see it generates.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.77,0:06:13.04,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,You can see Windows 2000 has the font that it's supposed to have in the older version.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.62,0:06:16.52,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Oh yeah, there's one thing I changed here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.85,0:06:24.10,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,In {\i1}Prank mode{\i0}, if I uncheck that, it displays a different message.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.62,0:06:31.02,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Also, I fixed margins on the Windows 7 screen, so it looks more accurate.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.80,0:06:39.19,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,So, this was the second devUpdate for the Blue Screen Simulator Plus 2.1 update, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.59,0:06:43.90,Tegelane1,,0,0,0,,Thanks for watching and have a nice day (maybe)!
