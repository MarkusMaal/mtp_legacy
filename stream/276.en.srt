Normal mode v.s. safe mode - In safe mode you can only launch the built in apps. In this mode you can safely transfer files to your computer in case it doesn't boot or is infected with malware. In this mode you can also test if your device is infected with a root-kit. In case the malware activates, even in safe mode, it will also activate after you factory reset your device.
